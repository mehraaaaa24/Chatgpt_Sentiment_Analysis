Notes:-
-We Used glove.6B.300d.txt as Word Embedding  After trying several files such as glove.twitter.6B.200d.txt and glove.6B.100d.txt
This produced the best accuracy.

-We also use 32,000 words in the dictionary, and we did an experiment with 15,000 as well, and the result was almost equal or a small difference.

-During the training experiments, we noticed that some models were fixed at a certain accuracy percentage, so we determined for that a number of epochs that are low in some percentage, but some of them may need a larger number to produce a higher accuracy, and this will take a very long time.
